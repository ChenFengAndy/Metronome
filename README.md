Metronome is a suite of parallel iterative algorithms that run natively on Hadoop's Next Generation YARN platform. 

*  Algorithms
    * Parallel Neural Networks
    * Parallel linear regression
    * Parallel logistic regression
    * Parallel K-means
    * Restricted Boltzmann Machines
    * Parallel Deep Belief Networks 
        * Developed directly in concert with [Adam Gibson and the DL4J project] (http://deeplearning4j.org)
        * [Running Deep Learning with Metronome on Hadoop] (https://github.com/jpatanooga/Metronome/wiki/Running-Deep-Learning-on-Metronome)
        * [Fundamental Architecture of our Deep Learning Library over at DL4J] (http://deeplearning4j.org/overview.html)
* Scales linearly with input size
* Built on top of BSP-style computation framework "Iterative Reduce" (Hadoop / YARN)
* Packaged in a new suite of parallel iterative algorithms called Metronome on [IterativeReduce] (https://github.com/emsixteeen/IterativeReduce)
    * 100% Java, ASF 2.0 Licensed, on github

# Project Next Steps

* 6/5/2014 - we're working on cutting a 0.1 tag and download for the current project snapshot for both
    * IterativeReduce
    * Metronome
