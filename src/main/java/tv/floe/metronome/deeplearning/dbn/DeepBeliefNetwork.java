/**
 * Base draft of a Deep Belief Network based on RBMs
 * (based on concepts by Hinton)
 * 
 * Literature Review and Notes
 * 
 * 1. http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/DBNPseudoCode
 * 
 * 
 *  1. Setup as a normal MLPN 
 *  - but it also has a set of RBM layers that matches the number of hidden layers
 *  
 *  2. as each RBM is trained
 *  - its weights and bias are transferred into the weights/bias of the MLPN
 * 
 * Deep Belief Network. This is a MultiLayer Perceptron Model
 * using Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
 *  See Hinton's practical guide to RBMs for great examples on
 *  how to train and tune parameters.

 * TODO:
 * - thoughts: are we going to train each layer separately as a yarn job?
 * 		- if so, how do we coordinate that?
 * 		- who tracks layer stuff, and how?
 * 
 * - IR: as long as all the workers advance their layer positing in sync, we should be good
 * 		to make this as one continuous job
 * 		-	need a way to save layers in progress to view in viewer
 *

	 * This is where we work through each RBM layer, learning an unsupervised

	 * This unsupervised learning method runs
	 * contrastive divergence on each RBM layer in the network.
	 * @param trainingRecords the input to train on
	 * @param k the k to use for running the RBM contrastive divergence.
	 * 
	 * The typical tip is that the higher k is the closer to the model
	 * you will be approximating due to more sampling. K = 1
	 * usually gives very good results and is the default in quite a few situations.
	 * 
	 * The training input to each successive layer is the activations of the hidden layer of the previous pretraining layer's RBM Hidden Neurons
